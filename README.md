# wifi-grabber-rubberducky
Script made by @norepository based on the code of Siem TTommy
- Simple script for Rubber Ducky that download wifi credentials, compress and send them to an email. After all console history and the file will be deleted automatically
- Make sure to change SENDER-EMAIL and SENDER-PASSWORD with credentials of the outlook account that will send the email and RECEIVER-EMAIL with the email that will receive the zip file
- **This is an updated version of the deprecated old gmail version, google is not allowing less secure apps anymore so i had to use outlook SMTP**
